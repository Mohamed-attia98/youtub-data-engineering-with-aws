## Overview
implemented a shell script that creates a pipeline to move the data to AWS S3. Subsequently, used AWS Lambda and Glue to perform transformations on the data, and stored it in a cleansed layer. Finally, analyzed the data using AWS QuickSight.

 ## Tools and services used:
 - __Amazon S3__:  Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
   - It is used as the staging layer for our raw data
   - Data Lake for raw, cleansed, and analytical data files
 - __AWS Glue__: A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics
   - Used as the Data integration tool for our project.
   - Discover and build our raw, cleansed, and analytical metadata.
   - Create a Catalog for our data lake so we can easily query our data using AWS Athena.
-  __AWS Athena__: Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
   - Query our data from the data lake
   - Put a structure over our data lake to query our data easily and in an efficient way.
-  __AWS Lambda__: Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
   - Extract, Transform our data files after they land in our raw data area.
   -  Make the ETL process automated using lambda triggers.
   - configure it to load the data from the raw area, clean it, and move it to the cleansed data area in our data lake.
- __QuickSight__: Serve as our BI tool to build our reports.
  - Connect to AWS Athena to load the data from our analytical storage area to build our reports.
  - Provide a secure connection, and automated reporting to enhance the decision-making process.
- __AWS IAM__: Identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
  - Define different roles for different users.
  - Allow managing data governance and Access management of different layers in our AWS S3 storage.
